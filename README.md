Emotional states are phenomena that profoundly influence an individualâ€™s daily life and professional performance. A critical issue in emotion research is whether the emotions identified through analysis truly reflect the underlying affective experience. In this regard, the inference of emotional states from brain waves is of particular importance. Unlike methods based on facial expressions, gestures, or vocal tone, the brain is less susceptible to conscious manipulation in this context. Therefore, in the present study, the valence and arousal dimensions of emotions were examined, and their prediction was investigated using machine learning techniques. Additionally, two distinct stimulus sets were developed to specifically elicit happiness and sadness.
